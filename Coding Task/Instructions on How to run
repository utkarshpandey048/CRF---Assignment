Steps to run the tests:

Pre-requisites: json and requests library


1) UI tests should be run first by executing the tests in 1 UISuite before running the API tests(2 APISuite).
   Users registered by executing UI tests are used for API tests in robot framework as well as for python unit tests.

2) python_file.py implements the api functions used by robot api tests and python unit tests

3) unittests.py contains the unit tests for the python_file.py functions.

4) Same test data should be used in robot UI tests and api tests as the user registered from UI are used for API calls.


5) Robot tests can be run directly from the editor or could be run via terminal.

6) In order to execute unittests,go to the project directory and execute the following command:
   python -m unittest -v unittests.TestMethods
